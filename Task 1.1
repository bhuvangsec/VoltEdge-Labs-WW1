Regions of Operation (nMOS)
(a) Cutoff Region
≈0
Transistor OFF
(b) Linear (Triode) Region
Condition:Channel fully formed
Acts as voltage-controlled resistor
Used in switching circuits
(c) Saturation Region
Condition:Channel pinched-off near drain
Drain current almost constant
Used in amplifiers

Threshold voltage is the minimum gate-to-source voltage required to form a strong inversion layer and allow current flow.

MOSFET is Voltage Controlled?
Gate is insulated by oxide layer.
No direct current flows into gate.
Gate and channel form a capacitor.
Gate voltage creates electric field.
Electric field controls channel charge.

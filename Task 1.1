A typical RISC processor uses a 5-stage pipeline. The stages and pipeline registers are:
Where:

IF → Instruction Fetch

ID → Instruction Decode

EX → Execute

MEM → Memory Access

WB → Write Back

Pipeline registers are used to store data between each stage.

2. Basic Pipeline Datapath

Main components used in the pipeline are:

Program Counter (PC)

Instruction Memory

Register File

ALU

Data Memory

Control Unit

Datapath for ADD Instruction
Means: R1 = R2 + R3

Flow of ADD instruction:

IF → Instruction is fetched

ID → Registers R2 and R3 are read

EX → ALU performs addition

MEM → No memory operation (skipped)

WB → Result is written to R1
Datapath for LOAD Instruction

Means: R1 = Memory[R2 + 4]

Flow of LOAD instruction:

IF → Instruction is fetched

ID → Base register R2 is read

EX → Address is calculated (R2 + 4)

MEM → Data is read from memory

WB → Data is written to R1

Hazard Detection Unit Placement

The Hazard Detection Unit is placed in the Instruction Decode (ID) stage, near the:

Register File

Control Unit

ID/EX Register

The 5-stage pipeline improves performance by executing multiple instructions simultaneously. ADD instruction mainly uses ALU, while LOAD instruction uses ALU and memory. The hazard detection unit helps in avoiding wrong execution due to dependencies.

Why CMOS needs both nMOS and pMOS?
CMOS uses nMOS for strong LOW and pMOS for strong HIGH, giving full voltage swing and low power.
2. Why CMOS inverter draws no static current?
Because at steady state, one transistor is always OFF, so no path exists from VDD to GND.
3. Which gate is faster: NAND or NOR? Why?
NAND is faster because nMOS (high mobility) is in series, while NOR has slow pMOS in series.
4. Define Noise Margin
Noise margin is the maximum noise voltage that does not affect correct logic operation.
5. Define Propagation Delay
Propagation delay is the time required for output to change after input transition.

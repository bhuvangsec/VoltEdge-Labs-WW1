Modern Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and microcontrollers mostly use Harvard or Modified Harvard architecture because it helps in improving speed and pipeline performance.
In Harvard architecture, instruction memory and data memory are separate and they have different buses. Due to this, the processor can fetch an instruction and access data at the same time. This reduces waiting time and avoids conflicts between instruction fetch and data access.
In Von Neumann architecture, both instruction and data use the same memory and bus. So, when the processor is fetching an instruction, it cannot access data at the same time. This causes a problem called the Von Neumann bottleneck, which reduces pipeline efficiency.
In pipelined processors, different stages work simultaneously. For example, while one instruction is being executed, another instruction is being fetched. Harvard architecture supports this parallel operation, which makes pipelining more effective and faster.
Modified Harvard architecture is commonly used in modern processors. In this architecture, instruction and data memories are separate internally, but they can share memory at higher levels. This provides both high speed and flexibility.
DSPs need to process large amounts of data continuously, such as audio and video signals. Microcontrollers are used in real-time systems. For these applications, fast and predictable performance is required. Harvard and Modified Harvard architectures help in achieving this by reducing memory delays.
Modern DSPs and microcontrollers use Harvard or Modified Harvard architecture because they allow simultaneous instruction and data access, reduce memory bottlenecks, and improve pipelining efficiency, which results in faster and more reliable performance.

CMOS Inverter Circuit
Structure
Consists of:
One pMOS (Pull-Up Network)
One nMOS (Pull-Down Network)
pMOS connected to VDD
nMOS connected to GND
Gates of both connected to Input (Vin)

Input = 0 (Logic LOW)
Vin = 0
pMOS → ON
nMOS → OFF
Output connected to VDD

Input = VDD (Logic HIGH)
Vin = VDD
pMOS → OFF
nMOS → ON
Output connected to GND

Noise margin is the maximum noise voltage that can be tolerated without affecting logic levels.
CMOS inverter uses one pMOS and one nMOS.
Vin = 0 → Vout = 1, Vin = 1 → Vout = 0.
VTC is steep → high gain.
Noise margin shows noise tolerance.
No DC path → zero static power.
Propagation delay due to capacitance.
